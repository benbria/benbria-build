# Ninja based build tool

This is a tool for building projects using [Ninja](http://martine.github.io/ninja/).  It assumes
your project follows a certain layout.

## Quick start

    npm install --save-dev benbria-build
    npm install --save-dev ninja-build
    npm install --save-dev coffee-script
    npm install --save-dev [other optional dependencies - see below]
    mkdir src
    echo "console.log 'hello world'" > src/index.coffee
    ./node_modules/.bin/benbria-configure-ninja
    ./node_modules/.bin/ninja

This `benbria-configure-ninja` configures the [Ninja](http://martine.github.io/ninja/) build
process, generating `build.ninja`. See the
[Ninja manual](http://martine.github.io/ninja/manual.html) for more information.

## Project Layout

This assumes you have a project with the following file structure:


    /
    |-- src
    +-- assets
        |-- js
        +-- css

  * /src - Server side source code goes here.  Every file here will be compiled into a .js and .map
    file in /lib.  This can include .js, .coffee, ._js, ._coffee.
  * /assets - Client side assets.  There are two different client side build types - debug and
    release.  Build artifacts will end up in /build/assets/debug or /build/assets/release,
    accordingly.
  * /assets/js - Client side source code.  This can include .js, .coffee.  coffee files can
    include snockets directives.  Any file that starts with an "_" will not be compiled - handy
    for files that are included via snockets and not used independently.
  * /assets/css - Client side CSS, right not being .styl. (TODO: Would be nice if
    we copied .css files.)

By convention we put browserify bundles in assets/browserify.  (We don't put them in assets/js,
since we don't want the files to by compiled into the build directory.)

## Dependencies

Your project should have any the following optional dependencies specified as dependencies or
devDependencies in it's project.json, and installed in the node_modules folder.  All of these are
optional; so long as you don't need the specified feature, you don't need them installed:

* coffee-script - Required for building .coffee files in /src.
* snockets-cli - Required for building coffee files in /assets.
* streamline - Required for building ._js and ._coffee files in /src.  If you are
  using < 0.10.x, then make sure you pass `--streamline8` to `build-configure-ninja`.  You can also
  use `--streamline-opts '--cb _cb'` to set whatever extra streamline options you want.  Streamline
  is not currently supported for files in /assets/js.
* stylus - required for building .styl files.  You can use
  `--stylus-opts '--import node_modules/nib/index.styl'` to set arbitrary extra stylus options.
* browserify - Required for building browserify bundles.  Note that in debug builds, benbria-build
  will automatically compute all dependencies for your bundle, so your bundle only be
  recompiled if it needs to be.  For release builds, dependencies are not detected, so the
  bundle will only be recompiled if the main file for the bundle is modified.

## Ninja Edges

`benbria-configure-ninja` will generate a ninja file with the following edges:

* `lint` - Lint all source files.

* `lib` - Compile all source files in /src to /lib.  This will automatically include:
  * `*.js` - Copied directly over.
  * `*.coffee`, `*.litcoffee`, `*.coffee.md` - Compiled to .coffee file.  Sourcemap will be
    generated.
  * `*._js`, `*._coffee` - Compiled with streamline compiler.  Souremaps will be generated if your
    streamline compiler is v0.10.x or better.  Note you need to specify --streamline8 for
    v0.8.x.  Lower than v0.8.x is not supported.

* `debug-assets` - Build files in the assets folders.  Compiled files go into build/assets/debug.
  Any files which start with an "_" will be excluded from the build:

  * `assets/js/*.coffee`, `assets/js/*.js` - Javascript: These will be compiled with snockets support.
  * `assets/*.styl` - CSS.

* `release-assets` - Same as `debug-assets` except compiled files go into build/assets/release.
  Also this will run all files through the "fingerprint" process, producing a
  build/release/fingerprints.json.

## Customizing the build

Build edges are generated by `factory` objects defined in src/ninjaFactories.coffee.  You can
define your own factories to customize your build process.  For example, to build a browserify
bundle as part of the build, create a file called `ninjaConfig.coffee`:

    {defineFactory} = require 'benbria-build'

    # Browserify bundle
    defineFactory "foo-bundle", {
        makeRules: (ninja, config) ->
            ['debug', 'release'].forEach (releaseType) ->
                cli = "$buildCoffee ./assets/foo/doBuild.coffee -o $out"
                cli += if (releaseType is 'release') then '' else ' --debug'

                ninja.rule("foo-#{releaseType}")
                    .run(cli)
                    .description "(#{releaseType}) BROWSERIFY $in"

        assetFiles: 'foo/src/foo.coffee'

        makeAssetEdge:  (ninja, source, target, releaseType) ->
            ninja.edge(target)
                .from(source)
                .using("foo-#{releaseType}")
            return [target]
    }

Then when you run benbria-configure-ninja:

    benbria-configure-ninja --require './ninjaConfig.coffee'

## Browserify bundles

You can register a factory to create a browserify bundle:

    # Browserify bundle for reporting
    defineBrowserifyFactory "inbox",
        "browserify/inbox/inbox.coffee",
        "inbox/inbox.js", {
            extensions: ['.coffee', '.jade']
            transforms: [
                'coffeeify'
                'browserify-jade'
                'aliasify'
                'includify'
                'rfolderify'
                'debowerify'
            ]
        }

This will read assets/browserify/inbox/inbox.coffee, and compile it to
build/assets/[buildtype]/js/inbox/inbox.js.  i18n-extractor is automatically run on the output,
and in debug mode a dependencies file is built, so ninja will know whether or not your js file
needs rebuilding.  For release mode, the bundle is automatically minified using uglify-js.

## Future improvements:

* Should support streamline in /assets.
* Could offer more control over browserify builds.
